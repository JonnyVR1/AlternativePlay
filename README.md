#  Alternative Play

## Introduction
This mod supports the following play styles

### ![IMG](AlternativePlay/Resources/BeatSaberColored64.png) Beat Saber
There are options to reverse the directions of each saber allowing for Reverse Style play.

### ![IMG](AlternativePlay/Resources/DarthMaulColored64.png) Darth Maul
Two controller mode allows you to play Darth Maul without a stick, or use two trackers mounted on a stick to play a proper staff style Darth Maul. You can also use one controller or one tracker to play one handed Darth Maul.  Reverse the Maul direction for those who wish to have the left saber facing left in one controller mode.

An option allows you to use both triggers to separate the Darth Maul sabers in two controller mode, or one trigger in one controller mode.  Increase or decrease the separation amount to widen or narrow the Darth Maul saber positions.

Play with one controller or tracker mounted on a stick for spear-like play.  Or use the Two Controller mode to play with a virtual spear drawn between both controllers.  Use the trigger to switch the controller to be the 'front' hand.
